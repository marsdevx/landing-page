# üåê Landing Page

This is an **educational project** where I recreated a **web page** based on the [MatteEngine design by The18](https://the18.design/freebies/matteengine). Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project includes custom **animations** to enhance the user experience and bring the design to life.

Feel free to explore and use this as a reference for learning or inspiration!
